# TcellSwarming

Code relating to the 2020 eLife paper "Cytotoxic T cells swarm by homotypic chemokine signalling”.

Three modules are included for:

1. calculating swarming index (`swarming_metric`)
2. performing agent-based simulations (`motilisim`)
3. extracting summary statistics of motile T cell populations (`motility_analysis`)

The swarming metric methodology was lead by Jack Hywood.

The simulation code and motility analysis portions are extensions from code initially developed by Mark N Read in:

> *MN Read, J Bailey, J Timmis and T Chtanova.* (2016). Leukocyte Motility Models Assessed through Simulation and Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Model Selection. **PLOS Computational Biology** 12(9):e1005082.
