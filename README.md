Three modules are included for:

1. calculating swarming index (`swarming_metric`)
2. performing agent-based simulations (`motilisim`)
3. extracting summary statistics of motile T cell populations (`motility_analysis`)

The swarming metric methodology was lead by Jack Hywood.

The simulation code and motility analysis portions are extensions from code initially developed by Mark N Read in:
